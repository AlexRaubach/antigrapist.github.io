		I really love the Malazan Series, but I've never actually managed to finish books 9 and 10. I'd like to actually finish the series, so I bought Dust of Dreams on Audible and I'm listening to it on long car rides. I should have it finished by the end of the year.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1736244298">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The plot structure felt lacking to me, it seemed more like three short stories stapled together rather than a complete novel. I liked the Western parts of the book, but the magical background of the hero just felt underdeveloped. I was told how powerful and dangerous he was but I never really saw that in action, except for his quick draw skills.

		I highly suggest reading the great book review blog <a href="http://www.pornokitsch.com/">Pornokitsch</a>. They do a great job of finding and providing detailed reviews of books that normally fly under the radar.
